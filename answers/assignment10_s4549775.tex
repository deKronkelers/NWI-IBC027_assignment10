When adding the key 36 it is inserted at the following position:

\begin{tikzpicture}[

\end{tikzpicture}

We could either color it black, which would violate property 5 ("For each node, all paths from node to descendant leaves contain same number of black nodes"): The path $38 \rightarrow 39 \rightarrow nil$ has a black heigth of 1 while $38 \rightarrow 35 \rightarrow 36 \rightarrow nil$ has a black height of 2.

Alternatively we could color it red which would violate property 4 ("If a node is red, then both its children are black.") because 36 is a child of 35 and 35 is red.

\section{} %2

The maximum height of a red-black tree is $2bh$, where $bh$ is the black height of the root node. Thus the maximum height of a red-black tree with $bh = k$ is $2k$. The leaf node $nil$ is always present so we need to add it as well, and subtract one from the exponent because the leaf node $nil$ exists only once.

We can calculate the maximum number of nodes which is $2^{2k - 1} + 1$.

The minimum number of nodes means that we do not have any red leafs. This means that the minimum number of nodes in a black-red tree of height $k$ is $2^{k - 1} + 1$. Again we need to subtract one from the exponent and add it back to the result because we only have one $nil$-node.

	is done as the left child of 27 but we cannot color it red because 27 is already red and we also cannot color it black because $32 \rightarrow nil$ has a smaller black height than $32 \rightarrow 27 \rightarrow 20 \rightarrow nil$. We color it red and fix the tree with a right rotation.

\section{} %4

You do not actually need parent pointers to traverse back up the tree because you begin by going down the tree and at this stage you can save the path you took to get to where you currently are. This could be done, for example, by using a recursive insertion function which would keep track of the path in the stack frames. Alternatively you could have an iterative traversal function and store a list containing all the nodes in the path to where we are now. This would be more efficient but also more complicated.

In the recursive approach we would just fix the problem at the current node, then return, which gets us one level higher where we can proceed doing the same until we return from the oldest stack (that which contains the root node) frame and are done.

The drawback of the recursive approach would be that you would have a lot of duplication because in each stack frame you would need to store more than one node because fixing one level requires some insight into the levels above. Many of the stack frames would contain overlapping information.

\paragraph{Correctness \& Complexity}
The correctness and complexity would carry over from the original algorithm because we do not change it. We just change how we retrieve parent nodes. Storing a constant amount of nodes in a stack frame is $O(1)$ and does not affect the complexity.

The space complexity would be $O(\log n)$ because we need to store something constant ($O(1)$) for each node we visit which are $O(\log n)$ nodes.

\section{} %5

You can transform any n-node binary search tree (BST) into a BST where all non-nil nodes are right children in $O(n)$ rotations. (You could also do this fore left children, the point is that we can reach this starting position in $O(n)$.)

From this position we can make any BST we want to in another $O(n)$ rotations.

We need a total of $O(2n) = O(n)$ rotations to transform any BST into any other BST. The rotations preserve the BST invariants.
